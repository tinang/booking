Basic features\r\n  * Render booking data\r\n  * Make a new reservation\r\n  * **Missing drag and drop**\r\n2. What's inside?\r\n  * `index.html` is main template file\r\n  * `app.js` is the main javascript file. `gulp webpack` will minimize all javascript files to `app.js` in \"production\"\r\n  * The same for `component.scss`, this file includes all needed css files and compile to `components.css` in \"production\"\r\n  * All templates (html file) will be compiled to `templates.js`\r\n3. Planning for UI fine-grained booking\r\n  * Currently I don't have any specific idea for this feature. In demo, I just set specific color for each booking type.\r\n  * Distance between `start-date` and `end-date` of a booking will be calculated by \"day\" unit, 1 day is 100% width of one column. We can use the same way for half-day (50% width) and per-hours `hours*100/24`% width\r\n4.
